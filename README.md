# petermarty.design

This is the website for Peter Marty Design, a Digital Design, Development, and Consulting business. There is a long list of items to polish and improve the site and can be seen in the [`future-improvements.md` file](/future-improvements.md).

## What's Excluded

I have excluded the customized and abstracted Gulp.js build for the time being as there are a few refinements that need to be made before it is ready to publish.

## What's Included

I have included all of the pre-build source code in case you are interested in poking around a bit, (although much of it is of no use until it is matched with the configured build setup).

## Tools Used

The following tools are used for this project:

 * Build - Node 6.11.0, Gulp â€“ Purposely not committed to this project
 * Packages - npm
 * Docs - YuiDocs
 * JavaScript - Browserify, Babelify, Uglify, ESLint
 * Stylesheets - PostCSS, CSSNext, CSSClean
 * HTML - Liquid
 * Images - ImageMin
 * Linting - JSLint, CSSLint
