                <p class="u-textFontSizeMedium">Great design simplifies the chaos and is aesthetically pleasing right&quest; True, but before we accomplish great design, we first need a solid understanding of the business&apos; and customer&apos;s needs to solve their unique problem. We set out to solve these problems with a human-centered design approach.</p>
                <p>A human-centered design approach means that we determine how the users of a product/service think and naturally behave so we can remove the chaos and frustration from their journey. Designing in this fashion creates a seamless experience for the user, resulting in less wasted time so they can accomplish what they set out to do, in a natural way.</p>
