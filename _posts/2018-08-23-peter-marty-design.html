    <p>The website for Peter Marty Design is a project that is very near and dear to me because it is the first online digital space for our business. This post is an in depth view into the case study from this <a href="/portfolio/peter-marty-design">portfolio entry</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="u-vr_x2">
    <h2 class="u-textPageHeadingH2 u-vr_x2">Inspiration for this Entry</h2>

    <p>People seeking the expertise of User Experience Design represent a primary target audience for us. As a primary skill set, User Experience is what we are most passionate about. This audience needs to see practical implementation and process from an in&hyphen;depth project case study. Our main audience only requires a general outline of our project work. We solved this conundrum by keeping the general work pages in a consistent project outline format while putting the more in depth case studies into our blog &mdash; just like the one you are reading right now. &lpar;Don't worry, we're not watching you&rpar; &mdash; with consistent tagging cross&hyphen;linking between the two.</p>

    <h2 class="u-textPageHeadingH2 u-vr_x2">Let the Games Begin</h2>

    <p>We know our product and offerings intimately, so we began this project by laying out a digital roadmap for research, branding, content strategy, and content management. We brought in copywriting, visual design, photography, and development to complete the picture. Being a User Experience Designer with a background as a Senior Front&hyphen;End Engineer, and a specialization in Accessibility, I have a unique and holistic insight into the project process from inception to completion. The process of strategy, discovery and design is always iterative; we continue cycling through until we arrive at the best result. Outlined below are the steps that brought us to the best solution.</p>
</div>

<div class="u-vr_x2">
    <h2 class="u-textPageHeadingH2 u-vr_x2">Discovery and Strategy</h2>

    <p>We began our discovery phase by doing some market research to help define and document all of the requirements and goals for the business. To assist in this exercise, we performed a competitive analysis that identified any user needs we may be overlooking. This helped us gain insights into the key differentiators and value propositions that will set our business apart, and set the ground work for our content strategy.</p>
</div>

<div class="u-vr_x2">
    <h2 class="u-textPageHeadingH2 u-vr_x2">Building the Bones</h2>

    <p>Our discovery research findings had us boiling over the edges with creative ideas to get this site structure in place. We began by laying out a general sitemap for the pages and their respective entry and exit points. This allows us to generally map the user&apos;s flow before we wireframe and organize our content in more detail.</p>

    <p>One of our favorite parts of the process is this next step&colon; We gathered all of our ideas on paper through sketching, wireframing, and component ideation to organize and layout our content. Once we completed these exercizes, we scrapped the noticeably silly ideas and A/B tested some of the ones that made the cut with a simple visual questionnaire. We then proceeded to code them into an interactive prototype for real world usability testing. We were doing great on time so we were able to sneak a few of our accessibility interaction tests for the mobile menu and breadcrumbs into the prototype.</p>

    <p>After coding the dynamic prototypes, we started our user testing as quickly as possible. We set out to do this through writing a list of tasks that we gave to each user, &lpar;some of our past and present clients&rpar;, to accomplish within our prototype, followed with a short few questions about their experience and advice. We set up a local server environment so we could proxy the url on our computer screens to document their interactions. The results showed us that our ideas and execution were mostly spot on, aside from a few small snags. We reworded two of the navigation items and reordered the layout for the &lsquo;Services&rsquo; page &lpar;to make it a little more compact and scannable&rpar;. We are not kidding ourselves. We know nothing is ever perfect. We added Google Analytics to the site so we can track how people are using it in the real world. This allows us to hyper&hyphen;focus on refining the content and design, according to what people expect, as the site and business grows.</p>
</div>

<div class="u-vr_x2">
    <h2 class="u-textPageHeadingH2 u-vr_x2">Branding</h2>

    <p>In line with our mission, we choose a color palette of earth tones for the website and logo. The color version of the logo represents an abstract form of the acronym for &lsquo;Peter Marty Design.&rsquo; The letter &lsquo;P&rsquo; is a sky blue hue that represents the sky as the limit for what we are capable of. The letter &lsquo;M&rsquo; is joining all three components of the logo to illustrate our holistic purpose of making connections. The &lsquo;D&rsquo; is a fresh, grass green hue that signifies our grounding principles and mission.</p>
</div>

<div class="u-vr_x2">
    <h2 class="u-textPageHeadingH2 u-vr_x2">Visual Design</h2>

    <p>Visual accessibility was highest on our priority list when building this site. For our typography we are using the typeface, Montserrat from the sans&hyphen;serif family. While sporting a larger x&hyphen;height, Montserrat is an evenly spaced font that scales upward nicely allowing it to be very legible to people with visual impairments. The line height and leading has an ample amount of breathing room while the line length allows for easy eye tracking. The globally implemented color contrast adheres to WCAG 2.0 AAA compliance, allowing for optimal viewing for people with visual impairments &lpar;such as color blindness&rpar;.</p>
</div>

<div class="u-vr_x2">
    <h2 class="u-textPageHeadingH2 u-vr_x2">Photography</h2>

    <p>For the photoshoot portion of the design we created storyboards for all of the page sections. This ensures that the photos connect with the final content &mdash; it allows us to acquire the necessary props for setting up the environment to execute the shoot effectively.</p>
</div>

<div class="u-vr_x2">
    <h2 class="u-textPageHeadingH2 u-vr_x2">Development</h2>
    <p>One of the main requirements of this website is to make sure it scales well into the future by adapting to content and design changes. It needs to host a blog without having all of the weight of a content management system and database. To fulfill these requirements we chose the static site generator Jekyll. Jekyll allows us to create custom templates with Liquid, (Liquid is an open source templating language written in Ruby and created by Shopify), and store all of our website&apos;s data locally without a server side database; This  makes things very dynamic and speedy. Github also offers free hosting for sites built with Jekyll&excl;</p>

    <p>Some other nerdy stuff about the development: Although Jekyll is a build management system as well, it is quite limited in handling all of our development needs for this project. We decided to strip out much of Jekyll's built in system and implement our own hybrid version with Gulp.js. In doing so we are able to do things such as custom Javascript and CSS code quality checking according to our company's coding standards, code minification and compression for production, image optimization, and much more. We opted not to use the CSS pre-processing language of Sass that Jekyll encourages, but rather, PostCSS as it moreso embodies a future forward CSS approach to writing our code that is native to the language.</p>

    <h2 class="u-textPageHeadingH2 u-vr_x2">To Infinity, and Beyond&excl;</h2>

    <p>&hellip;in my best Buzz Lightyear voice. So here we are&excl; The end result that is in front of you is a lean, user centric, minimalist design that is driven by our content. It is a highly optimized, user friendly, accessible, custom front&hyphen;end code base with a light, lean, database&hyphen;free back end, that is usable and inclusive of everyone. We are however, always thinking forward and already have a nice list of <a href="/future-improvements.md">enhancements</a> for this site that we will implement as we obtain more analytical data on how you utilize it – because the best way to design a successful system is centered around you.</p>

    <p>A goal of the blog that you are reading is to provide more in depth case studies like this one. We also plan to create blog posts that support the content we provide. This will allow our visitors and partners to understand how we approach and build successful projects, as well as gain a deeper understanding into trade&hyphen;specific terminology and concepts. One of our biggest challenges for this project was not designing all of the bell and whistle nice to haves because we were under tight time constraints to deploy. We have a nice list of future improvements</a> that we will be adding on little by little so we hope you revisit us. Thank you for joining us on this journey.</p>
