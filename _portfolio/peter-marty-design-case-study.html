            <p>The objective at Peter Marty Design is straightforward: Provide high quality solutions to like-minded people while building meaningful partnerships. To communicate this we created a content-first website with an information architecture that is easy to navigate. We wrapped everything in a modern, elegant design.</p>

                <p>The web is a place that everyone should have equal access to, and we aim to be inclusive of that market â€“ the everyone market. In our country alone, over 57 million Americans have a disability, so of course we designed this project with accessibility at the forefront.</p>

                <p>To ensure the effective execution of a seamless solution accross all devices, we included it all&colon; strategic planning and research; focussed user testing, interaction design, visual design and branding; resulting in a highly optimized user interface, with a dynamically extensible back end.</p>

                <p>A thorough roadmapping exercise was highly beneficial to this project&apos;s success. We started by identifying everything we wanted to be included, as well as everything that was nice to have. This high level roadmap was a success because we left room to adjust the iterative details as the project progressed forward.</p>
