    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>Located in the University of Minnesota campus neighborhood of Cedar Riverside, this bustling coffee shop has a natural and earthy atmosphere. The aroma of freshly roasted, direct trade beans invites you to sit down, relax, and enjoy your custom brewed cuppa. Mapps Coffee required a web presence that was easily accessible to their visitors on the go. Having no online home prior to this project, it was a fun and innovative journey to create and develop. The final solution included a responsive, adaptable, custom coded Wordpress theme that was fully manageable by the Mapps team.</p>
