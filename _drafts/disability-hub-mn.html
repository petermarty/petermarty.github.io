    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>"Disability Hub MN is a free statewide resource network that helps people with disabilities solve problems" Our job as a partner was to design and develop their first client facing website to be accessible to their user base. This website interacted with and referenced many different systems which we had no control over, making the most challenging aspect </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>After doing a bit of user research, some A/B testing and prototyping, we put this site in front of some folks in our target audience to get some real world use to validate the designs. We then employed a user centric minimalist design approach that is content driven.</p>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>Peter was the Front-End Development team lead and Consultant for the UX team on this project. He worked closely with the UX team to ensure visiual accessibility was acheived, assisted with user research and interviews, tested and validated functionality through Front-End prototypes, </p>
