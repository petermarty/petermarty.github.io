    <p>Tucked away on the banks of the Mississippi river in the Northeast Minneapolis' warehouse district, Sip Coffeebar is a cozy little shop with a modern touch. They requested an updated, mobile friendly, user focused web presence that matched the feel of their physical location. We set out to accomplish this through user interviews, wireframing, designing, prototyping, user testing, and developing a custom developed Wordpress solution that was fully manageable and maintainable into the future of Sipcoffebar as the business grows.</p>

    <h2>Testimonial</h2>
    <blockquote id="testimonial">We are so happy with the website that Peter Marty created for us. He put a lot of care into designing a website that reinforces our brand. Our new site is organized, visually appealing, and easy to navigate. And, best of all, Peter made our site to last, because he designed it in a way that allows us to update the content ourselves—and he showed us how! We highly recommend working with Peter—he provided personalized service at a great rate that we just couldn't get working with a large firm.</blockquote>
