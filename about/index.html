    <p>Hello, my name is Peter! Life Partner to my Best Friend, Proud Parent of our three Beautiful Children, Passionate Artist, Amateur Woodworker, Nature Enthusiast, Wannabe Guitarist, Lover of Life, and you guessed it, Owner of Peter Marty Design.</p>

    <p>I have been fortunate to travel our beautiful planet by backpacking across this country and back to spend time in nature, living and volunteering with the native Maori tribes in the forests, mountains, and coastal areas of New Zealand, and re-locating to the lush valleys, sandy deserts and coastal towns of Yemen to live with and learn from some of the poorest, and happiest people I have ever met.</p>

    <p>Eight years ago, these experiences caused me to think long and hard about how I could use my talents in art, design, and soon to be computer engineering to do good. I was ready to move out of my career as a Carpenter, we had just welcomed our first born child into our home and our family was starting to grow quickly. We care deeply about instilling the loving values in our children to be compassionate to others and care for the planet we live on. Fast forward to working my way through school and climbing the corporate ladder with some of the brightest minds in the business, I now own and operate Peter Marty Design. I am able to give back through providing some pretty kick ass digital services for like-minded people who share my passions and goals.</p>
